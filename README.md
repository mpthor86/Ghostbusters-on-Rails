# Ghostbusters on Rails
This is a Rails web app that lets you report ghosts and have then get busted by our beloved Ghostbusters.  There is site save accounts and the option to log in with google.

## Install
To use the app run bundle install in your terminal.  Then rails db:migrate.  Next, rails db:seed to get the busters into the app, along with some users to play with.

## Running the App
Now you can start up the server with rails s in the console.  You will be directed by Puma to either localhost:3000 or [::1]:3000.  Only thing to do is to click on the listening on link and the site will open in your browser.
